                  <p>Burt Munro was the subject of a 2005 film, The World's Fastest Indian, based on a composite of his Bonneville speed runs. The film shows an old man who continues to believe in his dream despite the difficulties of life. His dream is to beat the speed record with his motorcycle, an Indian Scout. To get there, he will live his passion day and night.</p>
                  <p>This film shows us that a man's passion can move mountains. No matter what others think about our dream, the important thing is to believe in ourselves. I have a dream and you?</p>
